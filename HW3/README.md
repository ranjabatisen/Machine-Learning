# Machine Learning Homework 3

Implemented a muli-layer fully connected neural network and a convolutional neural network using pytorch on MNIST dataset.

For the fully connected neural network :
```
 Input: 1-channel input, size 28x28
 Keep batch size as 32.
 Fully connected layer 1: Input with bias; output - 128
 ReLu Layer
 Fully connected layer 2: input - 128; output - 10
 Softmax layer
 Use cross entropy as loss function
 Use SGD as optimizer.
```
